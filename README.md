# Library-Managment-System
ESE 224 Final Project for Fall 2022.  

# to anyone that might play around with the code
The system works off of textfiles for storage as well as json.

If you want to make your own set of logins, and books, the following need to be done:  
1. New User data needs to be formatted EXACTLY as the current "student.txt".
2. "student.txt" holds all login information and is what the system uses to check authorization. Later on in program it works off a json object. 
3. New book data needs to be formatted EXACTLY as the current "book.txt".
4. "book.txt" holds all login information and is what the system uses to know what books are in system. Later on in program it works off a json object as well.
5. At no point should a user of the program touch the .json files. These will be maanaged automatically so dont feel the need/desire to wok onto them!


A sample set of login info would look like:
```
[0, 1, and 2 all indicate privledges to the system. 0 is a Student, 1 is a Teacher, 2 is a Librarian]
2	Westery	HereTree	
0 Mike qwerty
1 Alfonozo 6735109
```

A sample set of book info would look like:
```
[Information for books is stored in order as: ISBN TITLE AUTHOR GENRE NUMBEROFCOPIES]
